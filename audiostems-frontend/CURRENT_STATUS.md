# Current Status - MSC & Co Platform

## ‚úÖ What is Working
- Auth0 authentication (login, logout, session, user profile)
- Role-based dashboards and navigation
- All main pages: dashboard, login, admin, artist, distribution, earnings, analytics, content management
- Content browsing and analytics (songs, stems, projects, playlists, etc.)
- Export functionality (PDF/Excel/CSV)
- Responsive UI and navigation
- Docker-based local development environment
- Build passes (`npm run build` successful)

## ‚ùå What is Broken / Known Issues
- Some admin/partner features use mock data or are not fully wired to backend
- Strapi is still present for content API but not for authentication
- Some legacy code for advanced features (collaboration, workflow triggers) may need refactoring for Auth0
- No social login or password reset (future Auth0 enhancements)
- Some error handling and edge cases may need improvement

## üõ†Ô∏è In Progress / Technical Debt
- Full backend integration for all admin/partner features
- Refactoring of any remaining Strapi/NextAuth logic in edge cases
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Automated tests and CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation and onboarding improvements
